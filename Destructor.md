# Exp.No:5.b
## Destructor

### AIM  
To Write a python code to implement destructor in given code.


### ALGORITHM

1. Begin the program.  
2. Define the `student` class.  
3. Inside the `student` class, define the `__init__` method (constructor) and the `__del__` method (destructor).  
4. Create an object `s2` of the `student` class. When the object `s2` is created, the `__init__` method is called, and its print statements are executed.  
5. Use the `del` statement to delete the object `s2`. This triggers the `__del__` method (destructor), and the respective print statements are executed.  
6. Terminate the program.

### PROGRAM
class Type:

    def __new__(cls,*args,**kwargs):
        print("new executing")
        return super().__new__(cls)
    def __init__(self):
        print("init executing")
    def __del__(self):
        print("del executing")
obj1=Type()

obj2=Type()

del obj1

del obj2

print("end of program")
